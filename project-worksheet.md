## Project Description

This is a collection of projects I completed during Unit 1 of the SEIR course. Here are a few sites that inspired the design and functionality of my portfolio site.

Link To Site  | What I Incorporated to My Site | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| <https://www.lianapenn.com/> | skills icons section
| <https://www.dcfonts.com/> | portfolio grid layout, hover 
| <http://findmatthew.com/> | sticky nav bar, simple and modern style 


## Google Sheet

Link to my Google sheet is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1deWdcbHJbl85QS8QRVPZafFzkD-kRn1SLpAUso8vTqQ/edit?usp=sharing).

Link to my [Git Enterprise repo](https://git.generalassemb.ly/kimrass14/project-1-portfolio/commits/master/Portfolio_site) where I initially pushed up my files. You can see the first few commits dating back to the beginning of the project. Then I switched over to my personal Git repo.

## Wireframes

- [Mobile](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzxytz23k/image/upload/v1600035478/SEI%20-%20Project%201/SEI_-_Project_1_-_Mobile_wireframe_tedgrt.png)

  I tried using Figma to draft [my wireframes](https://www.figma.com/files/project/14816584/First-Project). The mobile version will have an icon at the top for the navigation menu. Each project image in the portfolio section will take up the width of the mobile screen. The project image will have a link to the project itself. Icons used to list skills / languages I have experience with. Contact section with be an a profile picture of me and include a form for user to fill in and message me directly.
  
- [Desktop](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzxytz23k/image/upload/v1600035478/SEI%20-%20Project%201/SEI_-_Project_1_-_Desktop_wireframe_qurstn.png)

  For the desktop version, the navigation at the top with display Home, Portfolio, Skills and Contact instead of just an icon. The project images will be three across the width of the page with a link to the project itself. Icons will be used to identify skills / languages I have experience with, will display in one row. Contact section will be an a profile picture of me, with a form for user to fill in and message me directly.

## Time/Priority Matrix 

[Kim's Matrix](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzxytz23k/image/upload/v1600047783/SEI%20-%20Project%201/Project_1_-_priority_matrix_eexb9x.jpg)

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Priority` Matix.  This involves drawing a a square.  In the middle of the square, on the x axis draw a line.  The most left part of the line should start with 0hrs and the end of the line should include 2hrs.  This line will be used to estimate how much time any one feature will take to complete. 

Now draw a vertical line on the y axis.  The top of this line should have `High` and the bottom `Low`.  This line will be used to assign a priority to to each feature you wish to include in the project.  

Now create a separate list starting with A and assign it one of the features.  Continue to assign each feature a letter.  Once complete add each letter to the matrix assigning based on what your feel it's prioirty is an how long it will take to implement. If any one feature takes longer than 2hrs to complete than break it down into smaller tasks and reassign them a new letter. 

Once complete tally up the time and determine how long the project will take to complete. Now break those features into MVP and PostMVP so you can guarantee you will have a fully functioning project to demo. 

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP

- Navigation bar
- Drop down menu
- Homepage
- Portfolio section framework
- Portfolio images and buttons
- Review API linking
- Link API data
- Skills icons
- Skills flexbox
- Contact section
- Responsiveness - grid and flexbox
- Responsiveness - other sections
- Add form for contact section

#### PostMVP 

- Projects - add hover, opacity
- Learn sticky nav bar
- Apply sticky nav bar
- Nav - highlight active section
- Skills carousel
- Tweaking fonts/colors/style
- Bootstrap lecture/tutorials
- Bootstrap execution

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### MVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | 
| Navigation bar | H | 1hr | 2hrs |
| Drop down menu | M | 2hrs | 2hrs |

## Code Snippet

Below is a brief code snippet of functionality that I am proud of and a brief description:  

```
//this added the project link as an attribute to the div in order to click on it. I thought href links could only be attributed to image or anchor elements.

const $div = $('<div class="indivProj"></div>')
$div.attr('href', elem.link)

$div.click(function () {
window.location = $(this).attr('href');
});
```

```
//JS file: added div to add opacity when hovering over the project tiles
      const $view = $('<div class="view"></div>')
      $view.text("View Project")
      $($div).append($view)
//CSS file: set default settings of new div then set opacity to .7 when hovered
      .view {
          opacity: 0;
          position: absolute;
          top: 0px;
          left: 0px;
          width: 100%;
          height: 100%;
          text-align: center;
          line-height: 200px;
          background-color: #D8D4D8;
          font-size: 20px;
      }
      .indivProj:hover .view {
          opacity: .7;
      }
```

## Issues and Resolutions
 Below is a list of all major issues encountered and their resolution:

**ERROR**: css styling wasn't being applied to certain elements

**RESOLUTION**: I was incorrectly selecting the element with a '.' in front of the id name instead of a '#'

**ERROR**: could not get newly created element appended to div using jQuery

**RESOLUTION**: moved the couple lines of code towards the end of the function

**ERROR**:unable to get site deployed

**RESOLUTION**:needed to create github.io repo using my username (thought I could just use my name). Needed to make sure I wasn't putting a repo inside another repo. Deleted some local repos, created new folder with only my html, css and js files for the site. Restarted the github creation of repo process and re-deployed.
